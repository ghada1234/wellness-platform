# üçΩÔ∏è AI Meal Planner Setup Guide - Google Gemini

## ‚úÖ What You Built

**AI-Powered Meal Planner** that generates personalized meal plans based on:
- ‚úÖ **Your Physical Metrics**: Weight, height, age, gender, activity level
- ‚úÖ **Calculated Nutrition**: BMR, TDEE, calories, protein, carbs, fat targets
- ‚úÖ **Your Preferences**: Cuisine preferences (from profile)
- ‚úÖ **Your Restrictions**: Allergies, dislikes, dietary restrictions (from profile)
- ‚úÖ **Your Goals**: Weight loss, maintenance, muscle gain
- ‚úÖ **Complete Recipes**: Ingredients, instructions, cooking times
- ‚úÖ **Shopping Lists**: Auto-generated from all meals

---

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **User Profile Integration**

The meal planner automatically loads data from your profile page:

```typescript
// Profile data loaded from Firebase/localStorage
{
  // Physical metrics
  weight: 81, height: 150, age: 35, gender: 'female',
  activityLevel: 'sedentary', goal: 'weight_loss',
  
  // Preferences & restrictions (from profile)
  cuisine: 'Italian, Mediterranean',  // Cuisine preferences
  allergies: 'Peanuts, Shellfish',    // Allergies
  dislikes: 'Mushrooms, Olives',      // Dislikes
  diet: 'Vegan, Gluten-Free'          // Dietary restrictions
}
```

### 2. **Automatic Nutrition Calculation**

Calculates your personalized targets using scientific formulas:

```typescript
// BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) - Mifflin-St Jeor Equation
BMR = 10 * weight + 6.25 * height - 5 * age - 161 (for females)
BMR = 10 * weight + 6.25 * height - 5 * age + 5 (for males)

// TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)
TDEE = BMR * activity_multiplier
// sedentary: 1.2, lightly_active: 1.375, moderately_active: 1.55, very_active: 1.725

// Calorie adjustment based on goal
weight_loss: TDEE - 500 calories
maintenance: TDEE
muscle_gain: TDEE + 300 calories

// Macros
protein: weight * 2.0g (for weight loss)
fat: 25% of calories
carbs: remaining calories
```

### 3. **Gemini AI Generation**

Sends all this data to Gemini AI which generates:
- ‚úÖ **Personalized meals** matching your cuisine preferences
- ‚úÖ **Precise nutrition** hitting your calculated targets
- ‚úÖ **Complete recipes** with ingredients and instructions
- ‚úÖ **Shopping list** consolidated by category
- ‚úÖ **Recommendations** for meal prep and success

## üìä Nutrition Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Weight Loss (Female)
```
Profile:
- Age: 35, Weight: 81kg, Height: 150cm, Female
- Activity: Sedentary, Goal: Weight Loss

Calculations:
- BMR = 10(81) + 6.25(150) - 5(35) - 161 = 1,412 cal/day
- TDEE = 1,412 √ó 1.2 = 1,694 cal/day
- Target = 1,694 - 500 = 1,194 cal/day

Macros:
- Protein: 81kg √ó 2.0g = 162g (648 cal, 54%)
- Fat: 1,194 √ó 0.25 = 298 cal = 33g (25%)
- Carbs: 1,194 - 648 - 298 = 248 cal = 62g (21%)
```

### Example 2: Muscle Gain (Male)
```
Profile:
- Age: 28, Weight: 70kg, Height: 175cm, Male
- Activity: Very Active, Goal: Muscle Gain

Calculations:
- BMR = 10(70) + 6.25(175) - 5(28) + 5 = 1,660 cal/day
- TDEE = 1,660 √ó 1.725 = 2,864 cal/day
- Target = 2,864 + 300 = 3,164 cal/day

Macros:
- Protein: 70kg √ó 2.2g = 154g (616 cal, 19%)
- Fat: 3,164 √ó 0.25 = 791 cal = 88g (25%)
- Carbs: 3,164 - 616 - 791 = 1,757 cal = 439g (56%)
```

  days: [
    {
      dayNumber: 1,
      date: "2025-10-22",
      meals: [
        {

## ‚ö° Performance & Caching

ai: {
  maxRequests: 10,
  windowMs: 60000 // 10 requests per minute
}
```

### Caching
```typescript
// Configured in: src/lib/cache.ts
cacheTTL.long // 30 minutes
// Meal plans cached by userId and date
```

### Cost Optimization
- **Caching**: Prevents duplicate requests
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents abuse
- **Smart generation**: Only generates when needed

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Profile Required" Error
**Solution**: Complete your profile at `/dashboard/profile`
- Add age, weight, height, gender
- Select activity level and goal

### Issue: "API Key Not Configured"
**Solution**: Check Vercel environment variable
1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Find `GEMINI_API_KEY`
3. Ensure it's set correctly

### Issue: Generation Takes Long Time
**Expected**: Gemini AI takes 10-30 seconds for complex meal plans
- 1-day plan: ~10 seconds
- 7-day plan: ~30 seconds
- 30-day plan: ~60 seconds

### Issue: Nutrition Doesn't Match Targets
**Solution**: Gemini tries its best, but may vary by ¬±10%
- This is normal for complex multi-day plans
- Daily totals aim to match targets closely

### Issue: Meals Don't Match Preferences
**Solution**: Update profile with more specific preferences
- Be specific: "Italian, Mediterranean" not just "Any"
- Add dietary restrictions: "Vegan, Gluten-Free"
- List allergies clearly
