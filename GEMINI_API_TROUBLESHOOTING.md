# üîß Gemini API Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ What I Just Fixed

**Problem:** "Many errors after adding Gemini API key"
**Cause:** Genkit wasn't receiving the API key properly
**Solution:** Updated `src/ai/genkit.ts` to explicitly pass the API key

---

## üéØ What Was Fixed:

### **Before (Broken):**
```typescript
export const ai = genkit({
  plugins: [googleAI()],  // ‚ùå Not receiving API key
  model: 'googleai/gemini-2.5-flash',  // ‚ùå Unstable model
});
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```typescript
export const ai = genkit({
  plugins: [
    googleAI({
      apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY,  // ‚úÖ Explicitly pass key
    })
  ],
  model: 'googleai/gemini-2.0-flash-exp',  // ‚úÖ Stable model
});
```

## üöÄ Next Steps:

### **1. Redeploy to Vercel** (3 minutes)

The fix is already on GitHub. You need to redeploy:

**If you already have a Vercel project:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/ghada-rabees-projects/mind-main/deployments
2. Click: "‚ãÆ" (three dots) on latest deployment
3. Click: "Redeploy"
4. Wait: 3 minutes

**If deploying for first time:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
2. Import: `ghada1234/mind-main1`
3. Add env variables (including GEMINI_API_KEY)
4. Deploy

---

### **2. Verify API Key is Set** (1 minute)

**Check Vercel Environment Variables:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/[your-project]/settings/environment-variables
2. Verify: `GEMINI_API_KEY` exists
3. Value should be: `AIzaSyDR54h--QKpVHWCuowWCjZXaK9OIUVHXBg`
4. Environment: Should be checked for Production, Preview, Development

**If missing or wrong:**
- Click "Edit"
- Update the value
- Save
- Redeploy

---

### **3. Test Each Feature** (5 minutes)

After redeployment, test in this order:

#### **Test 1: AI Hub** (Most Basic)
```
URL: /dashboard/ai-hub
Expected: Shows recommendations (demo or AI-powered)
Error: Should show demo mode if key still not working
```

#### **Test 2: Food Photo Analysis**
```
URL: /dashboard/nutrition
Tab: AI Insights
Action: Upload food photo
Expected: Gemini analyzes and identifies food
```

#### **Test 3: AI Meal Planner**

## üêõ Common Errors & Fixes:

### **Error: "Failed to generate recommendations"**
**Fix:**
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Look for "API Key available: true" in logs
